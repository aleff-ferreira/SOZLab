# Tutorial Changelog

## 2026-02-12
- Synced `README.md`, `docs/tutorial.md`, `docs/user_guide.md`, `docs/developer_guide.md`, `docs/design_notes.md`, and `docs/BUILD_TUTORIAL.md` to current UI/CLI behavior.
- Updated command references to current entry points (`sozlab-gui`, `sozlab-cli`) and current CLI subcommands (`run`, `validate`, `extract`).
- Removed deprecated/hidden workflow references from docs (Matrix/Heatmap and non-exposed H-bond/water-dynamics UI paths).
- Updated exploration docs to match current control surfaces (Timeline/Entry-Exit, Histogram/Event Raster, Bridges, Density, and simplified plot context menu).
- Revalidated docs examples against `/home/aleff/laao_water` with live `validate`, `run`, and `extract` commands.

## 2026-01-24
- Rewrote tutorial content to align with the then-current stepper structure and plot/export workflows.
